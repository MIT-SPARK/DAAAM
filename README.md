## Overview

DAAAM is a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding, building hierarchical 4D scene graphs with detailed natural language descriptions.

Key contributions:
- Novel optimization-based frontend for semantic descriptions from localized captioning models
- Hierarchical 4D scene graph construction with real-time performance
- State-of-the-art results on NaVQA and SG3D benchmarks
